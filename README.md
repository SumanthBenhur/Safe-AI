# Safe-AI
Seminar report on ethical AI - Research Paper

**Abstract**

The ‘dotcom’ bubble that started in the mid 1990’s proved to be the start of the Internet
era. The use of the Internet kept growing which led to the generation of enormous amounts of
data. With the rapid expansion of cloud computing in the early 2000’s enterprises could use this
data and the high computational power to build smart systems or intelligent systems which we
also call Artificially Intelligent systems (AI systems). This has proven to be of great strength to
enterprises, as AI took over different sectors of the industry and has proved itself to be the most
disruptive technology that humans ever created. But as the saying goes “With great power comes
great responsibility!!!”. Although AI has proven to be a very useful technology, there have been
instances in the past where AI systems failed badly which caused sentiment harm, monetary
harm and even harm to human life! So, with such great power at hand it becomes really
important for us to create a “Safe AI ecosystem”. In this paper we discuss a few case studies
where AI poses danger to privacy, life and other aspects and has not performed as expected. We
will also look into how organizations are keeping up with the ethical part of machine learning /
AI development and research.
